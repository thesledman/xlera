Greetings, I have a few simple existing non-drip forms on my website and would like to use them to send data to drip. Ideally I am looking to post the data via ajax to Drip behind the scenes with the customer never leaving my website. I have looked and tested the drip custom integration forms and ran into some issues. If a user fails form validation it sends them to drip to address errors,  I cannot have my users leave my website for any reason. Also, When building a custom form creating Checkboxes does not appear as an option, is this normal or is there a setting that needs to be activated. Thank you for your help on this matter.
