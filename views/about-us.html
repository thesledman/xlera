						<img class="d-block float-md-start d-md-inline-block img-fluid me-4 mb-4"
							 src="images/jesse-beeson.png">
						<p class="mb-4">As founder of Xlera Solutions, LLC, I’m always looking to have fun with
							engineering, advancing
							the influence of the FPGA
							and of those that build fantastic products and solutions powered by FPGAs. Over the years I
							have
							worked with all major
							FPGA vendors and their device families, across industries including networking, embedded,
							IoT,
							telecom, data center, and
							video. I am deeply drawn to the variety of creative projects and products that advance
							technology, then witnessing that
							creation along the way. It is rewarding knowing you had a part in that creation and success.
							There is something
							incredibly satisfying and just plain fun about working with and supporting other highly
							skilled
							and capable people.</p>
						<p class="mb-4">For over 20 years I have been working in and around technology, with an
							interest in multiple
							disciplines. Although
							formally trained as an electrical engineer and high speed design, I have spent many years
							with
							software, firmware, FPGAs
							(of course!), digital signal processing, and mechanical engineering projects as well. Often
							having active projects in
							different disciplines at a time, which really helps to keep one sharp with completely
							different
							development and debug
							challenges. However, my love of technology and other “cool things” goes back even further.
							As a
							kid, we would visit my
							uncle, who worked in chemistry and physics at Bell Labs. When I got old enough, I was able
							to
							spend a day with him at
							the Labs when visiting, where I could see his projects and those of his friends in other
							departments. I was fortunate to
							see some cool things, including fiber optics while still under development... Bend the fiber
							and
							the laser would shoot
							out, pretty neat (though I didn’t really know what I was looking at back then)! It was here,
							with a 3-ring binder with
							some handwritten notes from Kernighan & Ritchie, that I first learned the “C” programming
							language. Why was it called
							“C” you (may) ask? As the story goes, the “B” language wasn’t very good, the next iteration
							was
							“C” … that one seems to
							have done pretty well!</p>
						<p class="mb-4">While attending grad school in the 90s I started a consulting practice...
							well, more accurately, I fell into it. A
							company I had been working for during my senior year of undergrad, designing hazardous dust
							particle monitoring
							equipment (a project I’m still involved with today), asked if I would be willing to continue
							some work on the weekends
							when I went off to grad school. Little did I know I would run that consulting practice for
							more
							than 5 years.</p>
						<p class="mb-4">This experience lead to co-founding my first real startup, as CTO. We started
							a networking company in October of 2001…
							great timing right? Well, in hind-sight it actually turned out to be good timing for a
							variety
							of reasons, specifically
							that there was a lot of top talent suddenly available. Available, that is, if you could
							survive.
							We designed and
							manufactured IP video network monitoring equipment leveraging FPGAs, at the very beginning
							of
							what is now called Video
							Streaming or simply Streaming (we engineers creatively called it Network Video in the early
							days). We built a great team
							and survive we did! We began with 6 people and grew to a peak of over 180 people across
							several
							countries. That company
							still operates today, as a subsidiary of its acquirer.</p>
						<p class="mb-4">Ultimately I enjoy everything from the theory driving a project and its
							approach, all the way down to seeing it sitting
							on the bench with a blinking light! I am fascinated by building teams around ideas and a
							common
							purpose to bring those
							ideas to market. A balance of theory, practice, and execution.</p>
